There was an old lady who swallowed a cow.
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;
Fancy that to swallow a cat!
She swallowed the cat to catch the cow;
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!

There was an old lady who swallowed a spider;
That wriggled and wiggled and tickled inside her.
She swallowed the spider to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the cow;
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!

There was an old lady who swallowed a fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!
She swallowed the fly to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the cow;
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse...
...She's dead, of course!
